Computer game to be used with an arduino joystick as input.

Currently will only work on windows because the game autodetects which com port arduino is using via registry. 

1. Set up the arduino with the sketch and diagram found in sketch_joystickUnity folder.
2. Run the game, build file for windows 32 bit is included.
3. Leave joystick in default position for a few seconds to calibrate on start.
